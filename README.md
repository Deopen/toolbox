This is the current of “An Automata Toolbox”. 
It is a book of lecture notes about automata theory, based on a course at the University of Warsaw. The main goal is to give an intuitive – and visual as often as possible  – understanding of important constructions in automata theory.

The current version is an alpha version, and has not changed much for the last 5 years. I do plan eventually to update it, but this may be delayed a long time. In the meantime, you can fix anything here on github, and fix anything on your own. If you fix anything, don’t forget to add yourself to the acknowledgements, and let me know if you have doubts about or questions about your changes.

Before github, there was a page with mistakes, but I did not do a good job with integrating the corrections into the text.
