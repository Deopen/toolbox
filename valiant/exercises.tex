\exercise{zad:valiant-subgraphs}{
Design an algorithm, which for an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices answers
whether there exists a subgraph of $G$, which is
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a triangle, in time $\O(n^\omega)$;
  \item a cycle with $4$ vertices, in time $\O(n^{\omega})$;
  \item a cycle with $k$ vertices, in time $\O(n^{\omega})$;
  \item a clique with $4$ vertices, in time $\O(n^{1+\omega})$;
  \item a clique with $5$ vertices, in time $\O(n^{2+\omega})$;
  \item a clique with $6$ vertices, in time $\O(n^{2\omega})$;
  \item a clique with $3k$ vertices, in time $\O(n^{k\omega})$.

\exercise{zad:valiant-max-cut}{
Design an algorithm, which for an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with $3n$ vertices answers
whether there exists a subset $S \subseteq V$ with $|E(S, V\setminus S)| \geq k$
in time $\O(2^{n\omega}\cdot \textup{poly}(n))$
(by $E(A, B)$ we denote the set of all the edges with one endpoint in $A$ and another endpoint in $B$).

\exercise{zad:valiant-orthogonal}{
Let $U, V \subseteq \N^d$ be sets of $d$-dimensional vectors, each one with $n$ vectors.
Show that for $n \geq d$ one can check whether there are $u \in U$ and $v \in V$ such
that $u \perp v$ in time $o(n^2 d)$.
